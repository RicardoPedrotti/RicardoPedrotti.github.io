    During my time at ESPM I engaged in a number initiatives. One of them, the *Gamelab* club, was where I took role in a variety of gamification projects for external customers. There I started learning most of my key soft skills, such as teamwork and communication.

    I spent a lot of my free time developing new ideas for Startups. *Estacionas*, for example was developed to facilitate parking payment with the help of RFID technologies in 2016, now widely adopted in the brazilian market
    
    Beesports - the company I spent most time on - started as a graduation project on march 2018. The idea was to revolutionize data at the entry-level sports, measuring young athletes development over time with the help of IOT devices.
    By june, my associates and I won the biggest prize for enterpreneurs in our college: The *ESPM Entrepreneurship fair*.
    As a prize, our team received a space at a cooworking office.
