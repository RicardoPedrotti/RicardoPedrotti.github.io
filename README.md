# ricardopedrotti.github.io

This repository aims to keep a detailed CV copy of my professional life.
It is fully based on [sproogen modern-resume-theme](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme).

###You can see the live page [here](https://ricardopedrotti.github.io/) 

Since it runs on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), any deployment on the main branch will deploy the code to the running website.

In case you run into some questions, feel free to email me at rpedrottivf@gmail.com. :)
